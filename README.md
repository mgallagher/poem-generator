# poem-generator
This was originally a C++ school assignment, and I had enough fun with it that I thought I'd implement it in Python. This program reads in a text file of (ideally) a poem, counts how often each word occurs, and also how often following words occur. Once you call generate_poem with a desired poem length and a starting word, it will print to the console a 'poem' which ends up sounding surprisingly similar to the original poem. For example, with Annabel Lee by Edgar Allen Poe, this is what we can generate:

> Nevermore this soul of my soul grew denser perfumed from the beautiful annabel lee but we both adore tell this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt
